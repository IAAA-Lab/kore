# KORE: UML-2-GeoPackage toolkit

[![EUPL 1.2][eupl-12-shield]][eupl-12] [![Version][version-shield]](#)

GeoPackage may serve as an alternative or additional encoding for complex and large INSPIRE data sets.
This Repository contains a prototype for easing the implementation [UML-to-GeoPackage encoding rule](https://github.com/IAAA-Lab/U2G/blob/master/GeoPackage/geopackage-encoding-rule.md) 
which is based on the results of [Action 2017.2 on alternative encodings](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=277742184).
The documents of this work are based on the repository [INSPIRE-MIF 2017.2](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/2017.2).
