    Such grid is associated with an upper grid, that has a bigger resolution, and a lower grid that has a lower resolution. Some statistical grids are organised into a hierarchy of grids with different resolutions. The cells composing two linked grids have to satisfy some topological constraints: each cell of the upper grid should be the aggregation of cells of the lower grid.

    EXAMPLE The hierarchical structure is a quadtree if the grids are composed of quadrilateral cells and each cell is composed of less than four cells of the lower level."
