    description = "Human readable designator or name that allows a user or application to reference and distinguish the address from neighbour addresses, within the scope of a thoroughfare name, address area name, administrative unit name or postal designator, in which the address is situated.
  
    NOTE 1 The most common locators are designators like an address number, building number or flat identifier as well as the name of the property, complex or building.
  
    NOTE 2 The locator identifier(s) are most often only unambiguous and meaningful within the scope of the adjacent thoroughfare name, address area name or post code.
  
    NOTE 3 The locator could be composed of one or more designators e.g., address number, address number suffix, building number or name, floor number, flat or room identifier. In addition to these common locator types, also narrative or descriptive locators are possible.
  
    NOTE 4 The locators of an address could be composed as a hierarchy, where one level of locators identifies the real property or building while another level of locators identifies the flats or dwellings inside the property.
  
    EXAMPLE 1 In a Spanish city a "site-level" locator could identify a building on the thoroughfare name "Calle Gran Vía using the address number "8". If the building has four entrance doors, the door number "3" could be the "access-level" locator. The 3rd door could, via two staircases "A" and "B", give access to a number of floors, identified by a number "1" to "5" on which a number of dwellings are situated, also identified by numbers "1" to "3"; The "unit level" locator will thus composed of staircase-, floor- and dwelling identification e.g. "staircase A, floor 5, dwelling 1". In total, the three parent-child levels of locators uniquely identify the dwelling.
  
    EXAMPLE 2 In Copenhagen an "access level" locator could identify a specific entrance door in a building on the thoroughfare name "Wildersgade" using the address number "60A" (In Denmark the optional suffix is a part of the address number). The entrance door gives access to a number of floors, e.g, "st", "1", "2", "3", on which two dwellings are situated "tv" and "th". The "unit level" locator will thus be composed by a floor- and a door identifier: "2. th." (2nd floor, door to the right). In total, the two parent-child levels of locators uniquely identify the dwelling.
  
    EXAMPLE 3 In The Netherlands only one level of locators exists. The individual apartment within a large complex, a dwelling, a part of other kinds of buildings (for example an office), a mooring place or a place for the permanent placing of trailers are addressable objects which must have an address. This address is the only level of the locator. This locator could be composed by three attributes the house number, plus optionally an additional house letter, plus optionally an additional housenumber suffix.
  
    EXAMPLE 4 Sometimes the building name is an alternative identifier to the address number e.g. the house located in "Calle Santiago, 15, Elizondo-Baztán, Navarra, Spain" is also identified by the building name "Urtekoetxea""

  Attributes "AD_AddressAreaName" {
    description = "An address component which represents the name of a geographic area or locality that groups a number of addressable objects for addressing purposes, without being an administrative unit.
  
    NOTE 1 In some countries and regions an address area is a true subdivision of an administrative unit (most often a municipality), so that every address area is fully inside the municipality and so that every part of the municipality is within an address area. In other countries, the concept of address area names is less strict and based on local tradition or specific needs.
  
    NOTE 2 In some situations an address area name is not required to obtain unambiguousness; instead the purpose is to make the complete address more informative and descriptive, adding a well known place name (e.g. of a village or community) to the address. This is particularly useful if the municipality or post code covers a large area.
  
    EXAMPLE 1 In Sweden a "Kommundel" (en: Municipal sub division) is a type of address area names that ensures that street names are unique within the sub division.
  
    EXAMPLE 2 In Spain an "Entidad de población" (en: population entity) has the same function. It is the general address area which depending on its characteristics can be classified as "Entidad Singular" (en: singular entity) or "Entidad Colectiva" (en: collective entity). Moreover, according to the population distribution, these areas can contain one or several "Núcleo de población" (en: population core) and/or "Población diseminada" (en: scattered population).
  
    EXAMPLE 3 In Denmark "Supplerende bynavn" (en: Supplementary town name) is sometimes compulsory to ensure uniqueness of street names within the post code, sometimes it is just useful extra information, that makes the address more informative."

    description = "An identification of the fixed location of property by means of a structured composition of geographic names and identifiers.
  
    NOTE 1 The spatial object, referenced by the address, is defined as the "addressable object". The addressable object is not within the application schema, but it is possible to represent the address' reference to a cadastral parcel or a building through associations. It should, however, be noted that in different countries and regions, different traditions and/or regulations determine which object types should be regarded as addressable objects.
  
    NOTE 2 In most situations the addressable objects are current, real world objects. However, addresses may also reference objects which are planned, under construction or even historical.
  
    NOTE 3 Apart from the identification of the addressable objects (like e.g. buildings), addresses are very often used by a large number of other applications to identify object types e.g. statistics of the citizens living in the building, for taxation of the business entities that occupy the building, and the utility installations.
  
    NOTE 4 For different purposes, the identification of an address can be represented in different ways (see example 3).
  
    EXAMPLE 1 A property can e.g., be a plot of land, building, part of building, way of access or other construction,
  
    EXAMPLE 2 In the Netherlands the primary addressable objects are buildings and dwellings which may include parts of buildings, mooring places or places for the permanent placement of trailers (mobile homes), in the UK it is the lowest level of unit for the delivery of services, in the Czech Republic it is buildings and entrance doors.
  
    EXAMPLE 3 Addresses can be represented differently. In a human readable form an address in Spain and an address in Denmark could be represented like this: "Calle Mayor, 13, Cortijo del Marqués, 41037 Écija, Sevilla, España" or "Wildersgade 60A, st. th, 1408 Copenhagen K., Denmark"."

    NOTE 1 The postal descriptor is specified by means of a post code and/or names of the associated post office, town or area.
  
    NOTE 2 In some countries post codes are seen as a proper geographic subdivision of the country, in other countries the post code is regarded only as an attribute that characterizes a (usually small) number of adjacent postal delivery points and addresses.
  
    NOTE 3 The postal descriptors are created and developed on the basis of postal requirements (e.g. efficient sorting, logistics, transport and distribution). Consequently, there is not often a tight relationship between the postal areas and administrative units in the same area.
  
    NOTE 4 The structure schema and formats of national postal descriptor systems are different. Sometimes (for example in the UK) the post code itself is the only information required for a valid address; in other situations both the post code and the associated name of post office or town is required. Sometimes there is a simple relationship between the code and the name; in other situations a set of postcodes are associated with a single post office or town.
  
    NOTE 5 In some countries like e.g. The Republic of Ireland, no post code system currently exists, therefore the postal descriptor is only represented by the name of the post town.
  
    EXAMPLE 1 In the UK the post code "EC4M 7DR" is sufficient, as a postal descriptor, while the related town name "London" is informative, but not necessary in the postal address.
  
    EXAMPLE 2 In Sweden all postcodes starting with "80" is related to the postal name "Gävle". Therefore in the postal descriptor "802 74 Gävle", the postcode "802 74" bears all postal necessary information, while the town name "Gävle" is extra information.
  
    EXAMPLE 3 In Denmark, outside the centre of Copenhagen, each postcode has a 1:1 relationship to one post name only: Postcode "6372" relates to the village "Bylderup-Bov".
  
    EXAMPLE 4 In Germany the lowest level of the Postal descriptor (the 5 digit Postleitzahl) often does not fall within an administrative unit (e.g. municipality). The Postleitzahl is handled completely independent from the hierarchal systematic of the addresses. In addition, some "Postleitzahlen" represent not a delivery area, but institutions with a big amount of post."
